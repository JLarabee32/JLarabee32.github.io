    "text": "I am a graduate student at Michigan State University pursuing an M.S. in Data Science and a Graduate Certificate in Sports Analytics. My academic work focuses on statistical modeling, machine learning, and data engineering techniques applied to high velocity sports data. I currently work with SMT (SportsMEDIA Technology) on the RAZOR NHL platform, where I analyze NHL Player and Puck Tracking data to support performance insights, spatial analysis, and real time decision support tools. My experience spans data preprocessing, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and visualization within the hockey analytics ecosystem. Before transitioning into analytics, I spent time as a goalie, coach, and sports betting trader—experiences that shaped my understanding of the game and inform my approach to quantitative evaluation. I am also a graduate of Colorado College (Class of 2020). Thank you for visiting my website.
